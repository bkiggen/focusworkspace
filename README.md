Steam Store Clone
A clone of Steam's landing page, September 2018
By Ben Kiggen
Description
This is a 2-week project spanning units 2.2 and 2.3 in Epicodus' User Interfaces class. I was presented with a client's non-technical specs for a website and built a site, attending to each step of the design process. This includes hand sketching, wireframing using Adobe xD, prototyping using the same tool, and finally building the site in html, css (with Sass), and javascript (with jQuery).
