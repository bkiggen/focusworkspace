# FOCUS Workspace

A web presence for the workspace company, FOCUS. September 2018

By Ben Kiggen

## Description
This is a 2-week project spanning units 2.2 and 2.3 in Epicodus' User Interfaces class. I was presented with a client's non-technical specs for a website and built a site, attending to each step of the design process. This includes creating profiles and stories for main groups of potential users to guide development, hand sketching the layout, wireframing using Adobe xD, prototyping using the same tool, and finally building the site in html, css (with Sass), and javascript (with jQuery).

## Research

I did extensive research into the branding done for workspace companies, with specific attention paid to those in New York City. Something they all had in common was a simple, easy-to-navigate layout. They varied in their design styles but consistent across all of them was a sense of cleanliness and order. They often employed sparse layouts but were typically very aesthetically pleasing. The sites communicated that "this is a clean, stylish space where intelligent professionals do business". Clean lines, sans-serif fonts, and large hero headers.
